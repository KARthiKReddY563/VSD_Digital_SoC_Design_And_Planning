# VSD - Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning

2 Week digital VLSI SoC design and planning workshop with complete RTL2GDSII flow organised by VSD in collaboration with NASSCOM




##  Section 1 - Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK 

Task 1
  1. To run 'picorv32a' design synthesis using OpenLANE flow and generate necessary outputs.
  2. Calculate the Flop ratio.
       
       
Flop Ratio = Number of D Flip Flops / Total Number of Cells


Percentage of DFF's = Flop Ratio * 100

Implementation 

Commands to invoke the OpenLANE flow and perform synthesis
 
 ```# Change directory to openlane flow directory
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane

# alias docker='docker run -it -v $(pwd):/openLANE_flow -v $PDK_ROOT:$PDK_ROOT -e PDK_ROOT=$PDK_ROOT -u $(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER) efabless/openlane:v0.21'
# Since we have aliased the long command to 'docker' we can invoke the OpenLANE flow docker sub-system by just running this command
docker

# Now that we have entered the OpenLANE flow contained docker sub-system we can invoke the OpenLANE flow in the Interactive mode using the following command
./flow.tcl -interactive

# Now that OpenLANE flow is open we have to input the required packages for proper functionality of the OpenLANE flow
package require openlane 0.9

# Now the OpenLANE flow is ready to run any design and initially we have to prep the design creating some necessary files and directories for running a specific design which in our case is 'picorv32a'
prep -design picorv32a

# Now that the design is prepped and ready, we can run synthesis using following command
run_synthesis

# Exit from OpenLANE flow
exit

# Exit from OpenLANE flow docker sub-system
exit


 ```
